                <h2>What information does this site collect?</h2>
                <p>To help improve the site, I collect basic device information such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Device type and device language</li>
                    <li>Pages visited</li>
                    <li>Referer source</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This information helps me understand which devices are most commonly using the tool, allowing me to prioritize features and improvements that benefit the majority of users. For example, if I see many Chromebook users, I might focus on adding more Chrome OS-specific testing features.</p>
                <p>The site does not collect any personal information or store any data that could identify individual users or devices. For complete details about our data practices, please read our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                <h2>Do you collect microphone, camera, or other test data?</h2>
                <p>No, not at all. Feel free to use developer tools to inspect the network traffic and scripts used on this page. The only data I collect is mentioned above, and I prefer to collect as little as possible while still providing a good user experience.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>How do I grant camera permissions?</h2>
                <p>When you click "Test Cameras," your browser will prompt you to allow camera access. Click "Allow" to grant permission. If you accidentally deny permission, you can click the camera icon in your browser's address bar to change the setting.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Can I donate to this project?</h2>
                <p>At this point, no. I'm in the process of getting Google AdSense approved for this site. I feel like donations and ads are one or the other. It would feel disrespectful to show ads and also ask for donations.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>What are the operating costs for this website?</h2>
                <p>The biggest current cost is the domain, which is about $50 a year. I'm using GitHub Pages as a host, so there are no hosting costs. Id eventualy like to self host since this gives some more control over the page and would allow me to add more back-end logic as well add a speed test.</p>
            </div>            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>How can I send someone a specific test?</h2>
                <p>If you want to share a specific test with someone (like the keyboard test or camera test), you can use our <a href="/test-links">test links page</a> to find direct links to individual tests. This is useful when helping someone troubleshoot a specific hardware issue remotely.</p>
